    <h1>Postdisaster structural damage and performance assessment</h1>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Rapid post-disaster structural damage inspection and performance evaluation are crucial for building owners and
        policymakers to make informed risk management decisions. Traditional manual inspection is inefficient, labor
        intensive, inherently biased, and heavily rely on the proper training of inspectors. To address these
        challenges, this research project aims to propose a generic digital twin-supported framework for structural
        damage condition and performance assessment, using AI, computer vision, point clouds, and robotic technologies.
        The framework is illustrated below.</p>
