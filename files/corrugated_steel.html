    <h1>Design and assessment of frameless steel corrugated systems</h1>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Low-rise long-span steel structural systems are commonly used for non-residential buildings in Canada and the
        United States. These structures are typically designed using hot-rolled steel sections. In recent years, due to
        its lightweight nature, high initial stiffness, and economical advantages, cold-form steel corrugated walls
        (CFSCW) have been used to replace hot rolled steel sections and other concrete sections. In this study, a novel
        CFSCWs without boundary frames is proposed for non-residential building applications, known as Frameless
        Systems.</p>
