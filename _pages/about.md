I am an Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research falls in smart and resilient structural, earthquake, and construction engineering, which involves the development and application of machine learning, deep learning, robots, computer vision, sensor fusion, and innovative structural components and systems, to enhance the engineering practice through computer simulations, laboratory tests, and field validations.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
