I am an Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research falls in smart and resilient structural and construction engineering, which involves the development and application of machine learning, deep learning, robots, computer vision, sensor fusion, and innovative structural components and systems, to enhance the engineering practice through computer simulations, laboratory tests, and field validations.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.

Recent news
======
* May 2025, I have been nominated as a __Session Chair__ for the “AI for construction” technical session at the __International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE) Symposium Tokyo 2025__, which will be held in Tokyo, Japan, from May 18 to May 21, 2025. In addition, I’ll be presenting a research talk about “autonomous building indoor inspection using AI and unmanned aerial vehicles”. 
* Apr 2025, our recent review article titled “[__A review of recent advances in data driven computer vision methods for structural damage evaluation: algorithms, applications, challenges, and future opportunities__](https://rdcu.be/egj41)”, has been published in *__Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering__*. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of theories and applications, compliance with codes and guidelines, and future opportunities on Multimodal Vision Language Models, vision-enhanced multi-sensor fusion, and vision-equipped mobile inspection.
* Jan 2025, our collaborative project about [Large-scale shake table tests on a controlled rocking high-rise building](https://smartstructures.civil.ubc.ca/ilee-eerf-collaboration/prototype-building/) has been completed at the International Joint Research Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering (ILEE) in Shanghai. The project is led by the research teams at UBC (Dr. Tony Yang) and Tongji University (Dr. Yiqiu Lu), while other research teams at the University of Canterbury (Dr. Geoff Rodgers), South China University of Technology (Dr. Shuang Hou), and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Dr. Xiao Pan) contributed to the design and instrumentation of the project. In this project, I have led a team to investigate large language models, computer vision, 3D point clouds, and gyroscope technologies for high-precision measurement of the high-rise structure.
* Dec 2024, the research teams at the [Smart Infrastructure and Construction Research Cluster (SICRC)](https://smartconstruction.apsc.ubc.ca/) at UBC secured a major research grant (CAD$8.3 million) titled "Accelerated code implementation of high-performance energy efficient and carbon-neutral modular buildings", funded by National Resources Canada (NRCan) and National Research Council Canada (NRC). As a Co-Investigator, I have led a team to develop and validate large language models for sensor-based monitoring of modular buildings.
* Nov 2024, our paper titled "[__Assessment of out-of-plane structural defects using parallel laser line scanning system__](https://doi.org/10.1111/mice.13102)" was awarded the __Structural Excellence Award__ by The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers.
* Oct 2024, I joined the [Smart Infrastructure and Construction Research Cluster (SICRC)](https://smartconstruction.apsc.ubc.ca/) at UBC as an Affiliated Board Member. The SICRC comprises elite researchers and leading industrial partners in Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Construction Management, to catalyze interdisciplinary research on smart infrastructure technologies.
